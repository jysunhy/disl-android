The Java finder works in the following order.

1. If there is a file "var.local" then it is used. It's supposed there is
JAVA_HOME specified as in the "var.local.tmpl".

2. If there is no such file then the script checks the environment for the
JAVA_HOME variable.

3. If the envorinment variable is not found the script tries to guess based on
currently prefered java compiler and derives the destination of JAVA_HOME.
