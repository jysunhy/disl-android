/**
 * This class implements a special form of PrintStream that is used by
 * the benchmarks. The class vaieable spec.harness.Context.out is made
 * to point to an instance of this class. The purpuse of the class is to
 * record validity check information with the recorded output. This is done
 * using one of nine integer values (0-8). 0 means the default validity checking
 * is to be used and is what a Context.out.println() would employ. The numbers 
 * 1 through 8 are used to set various valitity cheching rules. This class 
 * implements a set of println() type methods that allow the text output to be 
 * does so within the context of a certain validity cheching value. 
 *
 * These routines will output the valitity check value to the associated 
 * OutputStream unchanged. This will cause them to be output as the character 
 * values \u0000 to \u0008 these values are not normally used (the next one 
 * \u0009 is) so this should not cause a problem. However this is checked for 
 * in ValidityCheckOutputStream.
